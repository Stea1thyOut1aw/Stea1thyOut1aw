Hello! I'm Siddharth Sharma, Fresher in AI  seeking a career opportunity to apply my skills in AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I currently have expertise building programs in a variety of programming languages and also leaning about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and computer vision in domain of Housing sales, Social Media, Agriculture, Safety Works and Photography..

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various data analysis projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new data analysis techniques and tools.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data visualization, statistical analysis, and Python programming.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sidsha01@gmail.com

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R, SQL
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Databases:** MySQL

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. CIFAR - 100 Classification using CNN --> The goal of this project is to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset using a CNN model. We implement a CNN architecture, train it on the dataset, and calculate the accuracy of the newly trained model.
2. Titanic Surviors Preprocessed Model --> The goal of this project is to preprocess the Titanic dataset to create a clean and feature-rich dataset suitable for training machine learning models to predict survivors. This preprocessing pipeline addresses missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
3. Automated Cattle Detection --> The project aim is to showcase how YOLO can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of cattle monitoring and management, ultimately contributing to the advancement of modern agricultural practices.
